# Real-Time Operating System (RTOS)

A **Real-Time Operating System (RTOS)** is a specialized type of operating system designed to process data and execute tasks within strict timing constraints. It ensures that critical operations are performed within predefined deadlines, making it essential for applications where timing, reliability, and predictability are crucial.  

### 1. Features of RTOS

**1.1. Deterministic Behavior**:

- An RTOS guarantees predictable response times to events. It prioritizes real-time tasks over non-critical ones, ensuring that high-priority tasks are completed within their deadlines.

**1.2. Real-Time Scheduling**:

- RTOS uses scheduling algorithms like:
  - **Priority-based Preemptive Scheduling**: Tasks with higher priority preempt lower-priority tasks.
  - **Round Robin with Time Slicing**: Ensures fairness among tasks of equal priority.
  - **Rate Monotonic Scheduling (RMS)** and **Earliest Deadline First (EDF)**: Used in hard real-time systems to schedule periodic tasks.

**1.3. Small Footprint**:

- RTOSs are lightweight and optimized for resource-constrained environments like embedded systems.

**1.4. Multitasking**:

- It supports multitasking, allowing concurrent execution of multiple tasks (threads or processes).

**1.5. Inter-Task Communication and Synchronization**:

- RTOS provides mechanisms like semaphores, message queues, and mutexes to manage communication and synchronization between tasks.

**1.6. Real-Time Clock (RTC) Support**:

- Maintains accurate timing to ensure time-sensitive tasks run as required.

### 2. Types of RTOS

**2.1. Hard Real-Time Systems**:

- Tasks must meet deadlines under all circumstances. Failure to do so can result in catastrophic consequences.
- Example: Aerospace systems, pacemakers, anti-lock braking systems (ABS).

**2.2. Soft Real-Time Systems**:

- Deadlines are important but not critical. Occasional deadline misses are tolerable.
- Example: Video streaming, audio processing.

**2.3. Firm Real-Time Systems**:

- A task missing a deadline does not cause a complete system failure, but the task loses its value.
- Example: Industrial automation systems.

### 3. RTOS vs General-Purpose Operating Systems (GPOS)

### 7. Kernel 

The kernel is the core of an operating system that acts as a bridge between the hardware and software. It provides low-level abstractions for hardware resources, manages system resources, and facilitates communication between hardware and applications.

#### 7.1. Kernel Functions

**7.1.1. Process Management**

- Handles process creation, execution, suspension, and termination.
- Manages process scheduling to ensure fair CPU time allocation.
- Handles inter-process communication (IPC) and synchronization.

**7.1.2.  Memory Management**

- Allocates and deallocates memory for processes.

- Manages virtual memory, paging, and swapping to optimize RAM usage.

  >##### 7.1.2.1. Virtual Memory VM :
  >
  >**Virtual memory** is a technique that allows the OS to use more memory than is physically available on the system by creating a virtual address space. 
  >
  >Applications operate as if they have access to a large, contiguous block of memory, even if the physical RAM is smaller or fragmented.
  >
  >**How It Works**
  >
  >- The **kernel** maps virtual addresses (used by applications) to physical addresses (actual RAM locations) using a **page table**.
  >
  >- This abstraction allows:
  >
  >  - Multiple processes to coexist without directly interfering with each other.
  >  - Isolation and security, as one process cannot access another's memory directly.
  >
  >  --------
  >
  >##### 7.1.2.2. Paging
  >
  >- **Paging** is a memory management scheme where virtual memory is divided into fixed-sized blocks called **pages** (commonly 4 KB or 8 KB).
  >- Physical memory (RAM) is divided into corresponding blocks called **frames**.
  >
  >**How It Works**
  >
  >1. **Page Table:**
  >
  >   - Each process has a page table maintained by the kernel, which keeps track of where each virtual page maps in physical memory (or disk, if paged out).
  >
  >2. **Page Access:**
  >
  >   - When a process tries to access a virtual address, the kernel translates it into the corresponding physical address using the page table.
  >
  >3. **Page Faults:**
  >
  >   A **page fault** happens when a program tries to access a part of its memory (a **page**) that is **not currently in physical memory (RAM)**. Instead, the page might be stored on the disk (in the swap space or another file).
  >
  >   **When this occurs:**
  >
  >   1. **Program Requests Memory**:
  >
  >      - When your program accesses a specific piece of data, it uses a virtual address to find it.
  >
  >   2. **Kernel Checks the Page Table**:
  >
  >      - The kernel uses a **page table** to see if the virtual address corresponds to a page currently in physical memory (RAM).
  >      - If the page is **not in RAM**, a page fault is triggered.
  >
  >   3. **Kernel Retrieves the Page**:
  >
  >      - The kernel locates the missing page on the disk (e.g., in the swap space or a file).
  >      - It loads the page into a free frame (block) in RAM.
  >
  >   4. **Page Table Update**:
  >
  >      - The page table is updated to reflect that the page is now in RAM.
  >      - The virtual address now correctly maps to a physical address.
  >
  >   5. **Program Resumes Execution**:
  >
  >      - The kernel restarts the program at the point where it left off.
  >
  >      ---------------------------------------------------

  --------------------

  >##### 7.1.2.3. Swapping
  >
  >- Swapping is a mechanism where the kernel moves **inactive pages** (parts of a process's memory) from RAM to a **swap space** on disk to free up physical memory.
  >- The swap space is usually a dedicated partition or file on the hard disk.
  >
  >**How It Works**
  >
  >1. Identifying Pages to Swap:
  >   - The kernel uses algorithms (e.g., **Least Recently Used (LRU)**) to determine which pages are least likely to be needed soon.
  >2. Writing Pages to Disk:
  >   - Inactive pages are written to the swap space.
  >3. Reloading Pages:
  >   - When a swapped-out page is needed again, the kernel reloads it into RAM, potentially swapping out another page to make room.
  >
  >**Advantages of Swapping**
  >
  >- **Handles Memory Shortage**: Allows the system to run more processes than available physical memory can support.
  >- **Smooth Performance**: Prevents outright failure when RAM is exhausted by offloading inactive data.
  >
  >**Disadvantages of Swapping**
  >
  >- **Slower Access**: Disk operations are significantly slower than RAM, leading to performance degradation when swapping occurs frequently.
  >- **Wear and Tear**: On SSDs, excessive swapping can cause faster wear due to the limited write cycles.

- Prevents memory conflicts between applications.

- Manages device input/output (I/O) operations.

**7.1.4. File System Management**

- Organizes data storage and retrieval on storage devices.
- Manages file permissions, access, and metadata.

**7.1.5. Security and Access Control**

- Enforces security policies to protect against unauthorized access.
- Implements mechanisms like user authentication and process isolation.

**7.1.6. Networking**

- Manages network connections and ensures secure communication.

**7.1.7. Power Management**

- Optimizes power usage, especially in portable devices.
- Handles system hibernation, sleep, and wake-up events.

>**Hibernation** is a power-saving mode in an operating system where the computer saves the **entire state of the system (including the contents of RAM)** onto the hard disk or SSD and then completely powers off. When the computer is turned back on, the OS reloads the saved state, restoring the system to exactly where you left it.

#### 8. Difference Between Monolithic and Micro Kernels



![Monolithic Structure of Operating System - javatpoint](README.assets/monolithic-structure-of-operating-system2.png)

**8.1. Microkernel (Left Side)**

In a microkernel architecture, only essential services like inter-process communication (IPC), virtual memory, and scheduling are in the kernel space. Other services run in user space as separate processes.

**Components:**

1. **Application IPC**:
   - **Role**: Provides communication between applications.
   - Applications often need to send and receive data or requests. The microkernel facilitates this through **Inter-Process Communication (IPC)** mechanisms like message passing or shared memory.
2. **Unix Server**:
   - **Role**: A user-space service that handles Unix-like functionalities.
   - It manages user-level system calls (e.g., open, close, read, write) and provides a bridge between user applications and the kernel.
3. **Device Driver**:
   - **Role**: A user-space module to interact with hardware devices.
   - In a microkernel, device drivers are not part of the kernel itself but run in user space. The kernel only facilitates access and communication between the drivers and hardware.
4. **File Server**:
   - **Role**: Manages file-related operations like reading, writing, opening, and closing files.
   - It runs in user space and uses IPC to communicate with the kernel for hardware access or resource management.

--------------

**8.2. Monolithic Kernel (Right Side)**

In a monolithic kernel architecture, all OS components (device drivers, file system, etc.) run in the kernel space.

**Components:**

1. **VFS (Virtual File System)**:
   - **Role**: Provides an abstraction layer for different file systems.
   - VFS allows the OS to support multiple file systems (e.g., ext4, NTFS) transparently. Applications interact with the VFS instead of directly working with specific file system drivers.
2. **System Calls**:
   - **Role**: Interface between applications and the kernel.
   - Applications use system calls to request services from the kernel, such as file manipulation, memory allocation, or process creation.
3. **IPC (Inter-Process Communication)**:
   - **Role**: Enables communication between processes running in kernel or user space.
   - In a monolithic kernel, IPC mechanisms are built directly into the kernel for fast and efficient communication.
4. **File System**:
   - **Role**: Manages storage and retrieval of data on storage devices.
   - The file system directly interacts with hardware devices to perform operations like reading from or writing to a disk.
5. **Scheduler (Virtual Memory, Dispatcher)**:
   - **Role**: Manages the execution of processes and virtual memory.
   - The scheduler decides which process runs when, while the virtual memory manager optimizes RAM usage by managing paging and swapping.
6. **Device Driver**:
   - **Role**: Interfaces with hardware devices (e.g., keyboards, network cards).
   - In a monolithic kernel, device drivers are integrated into the kernel space, offering faster communication but with less isolation.

-------------

**Comparison**:

- **Microkernel**:
  - Separates user space and kernel space services.
  - Services like drivers and file servers communicate with the kernel using IPC.
  - More modular but slightly slower due to IPC overhead.
- **Monolithic Kernel**:
  - Combines all services in kernel space.
  - Provides faster execution due to the absence of IPC overhead.
  - Less modular and harder to debug if a service crashes.
