# QNX History

## 1.Origins and Early Development
- **1980**: Dan Dodge and Gordon Bell founded **Quantum Software Systems**.  
- The company released an operating system for the Intel 8088 called **Quantum UNIX (QUNIX)**.  
  Due to legal issues, the name was changed to **QNX**, and the company was renamed **QNX Software Systems**.  
- **QNX 2** followed in the 1980s, marketed as a real-time operating system for PCs. It was significantly more advanced than DOS but lost the commercial race.

## 2. QNX 4 and Advancements
- **1991**: The company released **QNX 4**, focusing on:
  - **POSIX** compatibility (Portable Operating System Interface).
  - A cleaner separation between client and server processes.  
- QNX 4 enjoyed a long lifespan, with occasional requests for support even decades later.

## 3. QNX Neutrino
- In the mid-1990s, work began on the next version of the operating system, leading to **QNX Neutrino 1.0**.  
- Key goals for Neutrino included:
  - Multi-platform support (earlier versions only ran on x86 computers).  
  - Development for architectures like MIPS, PPC (PowerPC), ARM, and SH, with continued x86 support.  
  - Introduction of **SMP** (Symmetric Multiprocessing).  
- Cisco played a key role in this development by requesting a MIPS version for its routers.

## 4. Automotive Success and Ownership Changes
- In the early 2000s, QNX gained popularity among companies developing infotainment systems for car manufacturers.  
- QNX Software Systems was sold to **Harman International**, a company specializing in automotive solutions.  
- Gordon Bell left QNX after this acquisition.

## 5. BlackBerry Era
- **2010**: Research In Motion (RIM, later renamed BlackBerry) purchased QNX from Harman International.  
- QNX became the basis for RIMâ€™s products:
  - **BlackBerry PlayBook** tablet (2010).  
  - BlackBerry smartphones running the **BB10** operating system.  
- Despite innovation, these products were commercially unsuccessful. By 2015, BlackBerry switched to Android and eventually shut down its smartphone business.  
- **2016**: Dan Dodge and several QNX veterans left QNX for Apple.

## 6. Current Status and Redesign
- Despite setbacks in the smartphone market, QNX remains popular in:
  - Automotive systems (e.g., infotainment and safety systems).  
  - Medical and industrial markets.  
- The latest version of QNX represents a major redesign since Neutrino 1.0, featuring:
  - 64-bit architecture support (**AArch64** and **x86_64**).  
  - Scalability for systems with up to 64 processors and 16TB of RAM.
