# Exploring QNX System
### 1. Processes

A **process** in QNX is a running instance of a program, similar to processes in other operating systems. However, QNX's microkernel architecture makes its process model unique compared to traditional monolithic kernels like those in Linux.

#### 1.1. **Characteristics of QNX Processes**

- **Microkernel Architecture**:

  - The core functionality (e.g., memory management, process management, path resolution) is minimal and resides in the **microkernel**.

  - Most system-level functionality (e.g., file systems, networking, drivers) is implemented as **stand-alone processes** in user space. This design isolates services, improving fault tolerance.

- **Process Structure**:

  - Each process consists of:
    - **Threads**: Streams of execution within the process. Threads share the process's resources (e.g., memory, file descriptors).
    - **Address Space**: Virtual memory space unique to the process.

  - Processes communicate with each other via **Inter-Process Communication (IPC)**, managed by the **microkernel**.

- **First Process: `procnto-smp-instr`**:

  - The **first process** created when the system starts.

  - Hosts the Neutrino microkernel and provides basic system services:
    - **Process Manager**: Handles process creation and management.
    - **Memory Manager**: Manages virtual memory.
    - **Path Manager**: Resolves pathnames and links them to the appropriate servers or resources.

  - This process is critical for the system's operation.

- **Types of Processes**: QNX systems typically consist of three types of processes:

  - **Kernel Processes**: Provide core system functionality (e.g., procnto-smp-instr).

  - **System Services**: User-space processes that implement functionality typically found in a monolithic kernel:
    - File systems
    - Networking (TCP/IP stack)
    - USB
    - Graphics drivers
    - Audio

  - **Application Processes**: Implement specific user-facing or system-specific functionality:
    - Shell, editors, compilers and utilities. 
    - Media players, browsers (for interactive systems)
    - Controllers, monitors (for embedded systems in automotive, industrial, or medical use cases)

- **Customization**:

  - A QNX system can be customized to include only the processes necessary for its intended function:

    - A **headless system** (no display or GUI) may exclude graphics processes.

    - A **simple controller** may omit a permanent file system.

      >In some embedded systems, such as those used in industrial control, automotive, or simple IoT devices, the system may not require the traditional **file system** (like the ones you see on your computer: NTFS, ext4, FAT32)



#### 1.2.  **Process Management**

- **Process Creation**:

  - Processes are created by the **process manager** in the kernel.

  - Applications or system services can spawn new processes as needed.

- **Listing Processes and Threads**:

  - The `pidin` command lists all processes and their threads in a running QNX system.

  - Each process is identified by a unique **process ID (PID)**.

  ```bash
  pidin
  ```

  ```bash

>--------------------------

- **Microkernel (procnto-smp-instr):**

  - `pid` = `1` → This is the main process hosting the QNX Neutrino microkernel.

  - Has multiple threads handling different tasks, such as:
    - Interrupts (`INTR`).
    - Message passing (`RECEIVE`).
    - Timing operations (`NANOSLEEP`).

- **Device Drivers:**

  - Processes like `devc-serminiuart` represent device drivers for serial communication.

  - They often wait in the `RECEIVE` state, ready to handle hardware or kernel messages.

- **System Services:**

  - Processes like `slogger2` handle logging.

  - Often blocked in states like `RECEIVE`, waiting for messages or signals from other processes.

- **Application Threads:**
  - Threads in the `io-sock` process are waiting on condition variables or semaphores for events like socket I/O.

-------------------

**Example**

```
692246   3 proc/boot/io-usb-otg          10r CONDVAR        (0x0)
```

1. **`pid` (Process ID):**
   - `692246`: This is the unique ID of the process running the `io-usb-otg` executable.
   - The `io-usb-otg` process is the USB On-The-Go (OTG) service, responsible for USB device handling.
2. **`tid` (Thread ID):**
   - `3`: The thread ID within the `io-usb-otg` process. This is the third thread of the process.
3. **`name`:**
   - `proc/boot/io-usb-otg`: The executable name or path for the USB OTG service.
4. **`prio` (Priority):**
   - `10`: The thread’s scheduling priority is 10.
   - Lower-priority numbers represent higher-priority threads. A value of `10` indicates a moderate priority.
5. **`STATE`:**
   - `CONDVAR`: The thread is currently blocked and waiting on a **condition variable**.
   - A condition variable is a synchronization primitive used to coordinate thread execution. The thread is likely waiting for a signal or notification from another thread to proceed.
6. **`Blocked`:**
   - `(0x0)`: Indicates the thread is waiting on a condition variable located at virtual address `0x0`.
   - Normally, the address here corresponds to the location of the condition variable in memory.
   - In your case, `0x0` means:
     - Either the condition variable hasn’t been properly initialized.
     - Or, it is waiting for a generic synchronization object not tied to a specific address.



### 2. QNX Memory 

RAM, is a shared resource that every process requires like the CPU. All processes compete with each other for use of memory. The operating system ensures that all processes get access to RAM without conflicts. This involves dividing the available memory among the processes.

- **Physical Memory**

  - The total amount of RAM available in the system.

  - Physical memory is divided into pages, typically 4 KB in size, which can be allocated to processes as needed.

- **Virtual Memory**

  - Each process has its own private virtual address space.

  - The virtual address space is split into:
    - **User space:** For application code, heap, stack, and libraries.
    - **Kernel space:** Reserved for system-level operations.

- **Shared Memory**

  - QNX supports **shared memory** to allow processes to communicate efficiently by accessing the same memory region.

  - Commonly used for **Inter-Process Communication (IPC)**.

- **Memory Pools**
  - QNX divides memory into pools:
    - **System Memory Pool:** Used by the kernel and system services.
    - **User Memory Pool:** Allocated for user processes.

**2.1. Memory Management in QNX**

- **Virtual Memory Manager (VMM):** QNX uses a Virtual Memory Manager to handle memory allocation and manage RAM effectively. The VMM ensures that each process gets its own isolated memory space and can interact with memory safely.

- **Procnto-smp-instr Process:**

  This is a special process in QNX that combines the **microkernel** with several essential services, including the virtual memory manager.

  

**2.2. How Memory Management Works**

1. **Virtual Memory:** Each process is given a **virtual address space**, which abstracts the physical RAM. This allows processes to behave as though they have their own dedicated memory.
2. **Memory Isolation:** Processes are isolated from one another, meaning one process cannot accidentally overwrite another's memory. This isolation is critical for system stability and security.
3. **Dynamic Allocation:** The VMM allocates and deallocates memory as processes start, run, and terminate. This ensures that memory is used efficiently.
4. **Shared Resources:** For shared resources or communication, the system allows controlled sharing of memory regions between processes using mechanisms like shared memory or IPC (Inter-Process Communication).

### 

**2.3. Memory Issues**

Running out of memory is a critical issue in any system, including QNX on a Raspberry Pi, where hardware resources are limited. This can occur due to misbehaving processes, poor system design, or a failure to account for the memory requirements of the software. So, there are two important questions

**2.3.1. How much memory does my system use ?**

We can run `pidin info`  in the QNX terminal to know

```bash
pidin info
```

------------------

> **Note That :** The QNX memory manager **may not have access to all of the RAM on a board** if certain factors limit its availability. 
>
> **Factors Affecting Available RAM** :
>
> 1. **Boot-Time Services**
>    - Some system services or configurations at boot time can reserve portions of RAM for their exclusive use.
>    - For example:
>      - **Firmware/BIOS:** Some RAM might be reserved for hardware initialization or runtime services.
>      - **Bootloader:** Certain memory regions may be reserved by the bootloader for its operations or passed to the OS as restricted.
> 2. **Hypervisors**
>    - If QNX is running as a guest OS under a hypervisor (e.g., in a virtualized environment), the hypervisor might allocate only a subset of the physical RAM to QNX.
>    - This allocation is typically defined by the hypervisor configuration and may be shared with other virtual machines.
> 3. **Hardware Reservations**
>    - Some hardware devices reserve portions of RAM for their own use.
>      - Examples:
>        - GPU: Graphics processing units may allocate memory for video buffers.
>        - DMA Buffers: Devices using Direct Memory Access (DMA) might lock certain RAM regions.
>      - On boards like the Raspberry Pi, part of the RAM is often reserved for the GPU by default.
> 4. **System Configuration and Memory Maps**
>    - The memory map provided to the QNX system at boot time defines which portions of RAM are available for use.
>    - If parts of RAM are marked as **reserved** or excluded in the memory map, the QNX memory manager will not use them.
> 5. **OS-Level Constraints**
>    - QNX may exclude certain RAM regions for its own internal purposes:
>      - **Reserved Memory Pools:** Memory reserved for specific applications or kernel services.
>      - **Real-Time Constraints:** Memory may be preallocated or locked for real-time applications to guarantee predictability.
> 6. **Defective or Faulty Memory**
>    - If a portion of RAM is identified as defective (e.g., during power-on self-test or diagnostics), it may be excluded to prevent system instability.

All entries that end with **sysram** are available for the memory manager to use when
servicing normal allocation requests from processes. Entries that are part of RAM but
outside the **sysram** ranges can be allocated using a special interface known as **typed
memory** .

### 3. Resource Managers

In the QNX operating system, **Resource Managers** are special processes that act as intermediaries between client applications and hardware or other system resources. They register a path in the filesystem (a virtual namespace called the "path space") and handle all requests related to that path.

**3.1. Path Registration**:

- A resource manager registers one or more paths in the system, like `/dev/gpio`.
- All requests to access files or directories under this path are routed to the resource manager.

**3.2. Message Handling**:

- The resource manager processes standard file operations such as `read`, `write`, `stat`, and `close`.
- It can also handle custom messages specific to the resource it manages.

**3.3. Examples**:

- A **file system** is a resource manager that manages files and directories.
- The **GPIO** resource manager (`rpi_gpio`) manages the GPIO hardware of the Raspberry Pi.

**3.4. The GPIO Resource Manager (`rpi_gpio`)** :

- The `rpi_gpio` process is a resource manager for the **40-pin GPIO header** on the Raspberry Pi 4.
- Its job is to:
  - Map the GPIO hardware registers into memory (using `mmap()`).
  - Control and manage access to the GPIO pins (input/output).
  - Handle requests from other processes to interact with GPIO pins (e.g., turning a pin on/off).

**3.5. Why Use a Resource Manager for GPIO?**

- To ensure safe and exclusive access:
  - Without the resource manager, multiple processes could access the GPIO hardware directly, leading to conflicts, accidental misconfigurations, or malicious interference.
- With `rpi_gpio`, only the resource manager accesses the hardware registers, and other processes send requests to it, ensuring controlled access.

**3.6. How to View the `rpi_gpio` Process**

Using the `pidin` command, you can see the `rpi_gpio` process running:

```bash
 pidin -p rpi_gpio
```

![image-20250120195723504](README.assets/image-20250120195723504.png)

> **What Does This Output Mean?**
>
> - **`pid`**: The process ID of the `rpi_gpio` resource manager is `823323`.
> - **`tid`**: Thread IDs for this process.
>   - Thread `1`: Handles incoming requests from clients (`RECEIVE` state).
>   - Thread `2`: Handles hardware interrupts (`INTR` state).
> - **`prio`**: The priority of each thread.
>   - Thread `1`: Priority `10r` (relatively low, handles general requests).
>   - Thread `2`: Priority `200r` (higher priority to respond to hardware events quickly).
> - **`STATE`**: Indicates the current state of the thread.
>   - `RECEIVE`: Waiting for a message from a client process.
>   - `INTR`: Responding to an interrupt.



**3.7. How Does `rpi_gpio` Manage GPIO Pins**

The rpi_gpio resource manager registers the path /dev/gpio (though it can be con-
figured to register a different path, if desired, via a command-line argument). Under
this path it creates a file for each GPIO pin, with a name matching that of the GPIO
number, as well as a single msg file.

```bash
ls /dev/gpio
```

  echo out > /dev/gpio/<GPIO_Number>
  ```

  ```echo
  echo out > /dev/gpio/2
  ```

  >**I use GPIO 2 (pin 3 in the digram)**

- Turn ON the GPIO 2 

  ```bash
  echo on > /dev/gpio/2
  ```

- Turn OFF the GPIO 2

  ```bash
  echo off > /dev/gpio/2
  ```

>**What Happens Internally** ?
>
>**1. Opening the File `/dev/gpio/2`**
>
>- The command `echo on > /dev/gpio/2` :
>  - Causes the shell to **open** the file `/dev/gpio/2` in write mode.
>  - This establishes a connection to the `rpi_gpio` resource manager through a **file descriptor**.
>
>**2. What Is a File Descriptor?**
>
>- A **file descriptor** is a small, non-negative integer used by the operating system to refer to an open file or resource.
>- The shell uses a file descriptor to communicate with `/dev/gpio/2` :
>  - Standard input (`stdin`): File descriptor 0.
>  - Standard output (`stdout`): File descriptor 1.
>  - Standard error (`stderr`): File descriptor 2.
>
>**For example:**
>
>```
>echo "message" > /dev/gpio/2
>```
>
>- Redirects the `stdout` (file descriptor 1) of the `echo` command to the GPIO file `/dev/gpio/2`.
>
>--------------------------
>
>**3. The Role of `echo` and `write()`**
>
>- The `echo` command outputs a string (`on`, `off`, etc.).
>- The shell redirects this output to the resource manager handling `/dev/gpio/16`.
>- Internally, the `echo` command calls the `write()` system call to send the string as a message to the resource manager.
>
>**4. Message Communication**
>
>- The `write()`system call sends a `_IO_WRITE` message to the resource manager.
>  - `_IO_WRITE` is a message type defined by QNX for write operations.
>  - The message payload includes:
>    - The string being written (`on`, `off`, `out`, etc.).
>    - Any other metadata needed for the resource manager to process the request.
>
>**5. Handling the `_IO_WRITE` Message**
>
>- The `rpi_gpio` resource manager receives the `_IO_WRITE` message from the shell.
>- It:
>  1. Identifies the file (`/dev/gpio/2`) associated with GPIO 2.
>  2. Parses the command (`on`, `off`, or `out`) from the message payload.
>  3. Updates the GPIO hardware registers:
>     - For `on`: Sets the GPIO pin state to HIGH.
>     - For `off`: Sets the GPIO pin state to LOW.
>     - For `out`: Configures the GPIO pin as an output.
>
>--------------------------------
>
>**Example Flow: `echo on > /dev/gpio/2`**
>
>1. **Shell Opens File**:
>   - The shell executes the `echo` command, opening `/dev/gpio/2` for writing.
>   - This creates a **file descriptor** connected to the resource manager.
>2. **Shell Redirects Output**:
>   - The `echo` command sends the string `on` to the file descriptor.
>3. **System Call**:
>   - The `echo` command internally invokes the `write()` system call on the file descriptor.
>   - The `write()` system call sends a `_IO_WRITE` message to the `rpi_gpio` resource manager.
>4. **Resource Manager Processing**:
>   - The `rpi_gpio` resource manager:
>     - Receives the `_IO_WRITE` message.
>     - Recognizes that it pertains to GPIO 2.
>     - Parses the string `on`.
>     - Updates the GPIO hardware register for GPIO Number 2 to set it to HIGH.
>5. **Hardware Update**:
>   - The GPIO 2 is now HIGH, meaning it outputs voltage.
>
>-----------------------------------
>
>**Ad-hoc Messages and the `msg` File**
>
>- **Ad-hoc messages**:
>
>  - Instead of using text commands (`on`, `off`, etc.), programs can send structured binary messages to the `msg` file under `/dev/gpio`.
>  - Ad-hoc messages are:
>    - Easier to parse.
>    - Less error-prone (since they avoid string parsing).
>  - The message structure is defined in a header file used by client programs.
>
>- Example:
>
>  - A program could send a binary message to 
>
>    ```
>    /dev/gpio/msg
>    ```
>
>     with:
>
>    - Pin number.
>    - Operation (e.g., set output, turn on/off).
>    - Any additional parameters.

**3.9. How Does the Resource Manager Work?**

1. **Memory Mapping:**

   - The resource manager uses `mmap()` to map the hardware registers controlling the GPIO pins into its process memory.

     >`mmap()` is a system call in Unix-like operating systems, including QNX, that allows processes to map files or devices into their address space. By mapping, it means that a region of a file or device or hardware is associated with a region of a process's virtual memory. This enables efficient access to files or device memory by treating them as if they were in memory.

   - This allows it to read/write directly to the GPIO registers without exposing them to other processes.

2. **Handling Client Requests:**

   - When a client process sends a `write` request to `/dev/gpio/2`, the resource manager turns GPIO 2 ON or OFF.
   - Similarly, `read` requests can retrieve the current state of the pin.

3. **Custom Messages:**

   - The `msg` file allows clients to send special requests to the resource manager, such as configuring a pin as input or output, or toggling advanced settings.

**3.10. Advantages of Using a Resource Manager**

1. **Exclusive Access**:
   - Only the resource manager interacts with hardware registers, preventing conflicts or damage.
2. **Simplified Interface**:
   - Applications interact with GPIOs using standard file operations (`read`, `write`, etc.), which are easier to use than direct hardware access.
3. **Safety and Security**:
   - Prevents accidental or malicious interference between processes using GPIOs.
4. **Flexibility**:
   - The resource manager can enforce policies, like only allowing specific processes to access certain pins.
